# Shared-contract changelog

Every change to the shared contract (S-004) gets an entry here, newest first. Each entry says what changed and has one acknowledgement item per part. A part acknowledges by making the change, or by pinning the previous version with a reason, and then ticks its item with a note.

Versions: bundle schema `MAJOR.MINOR`; catalogue `vN`.

## 2026-09-25: bundle schema 0.3 and catalogue v0 (planned)

- Bundle schema 0.3, defined in `case-library/docs/SPEC.md` §10. It extends Sambhasha's schema 0.2 with catalogue links, origins, ledger tiers, report variants with provisional or final status, consult notes, licence flags, the case laboratory profile and gaps.
- Catalogue id patterns `HX`, `EX`, `LAB`, `IMG`, `PROC`, `CMP`, `RX`, `ACT`, `REF`, `DX` and `FND` (findings) (Case Library SPEC §5).
- Licence flags `production_ok` and `public_release_ok`, on every case and separately on every figure (S-006).
- Condition vocabulary for rubric anchors, must-do and must-not-do, including `finding_released` (Case Library SPEC §10.4).
- A bundle's SHA-256 is the hash of the exported file's bytes, kept in a `.sha256` file beside it (Case Library SPEC §10.5).

Acknowledgements:

- [x] Nidana: designed against schema 0.3 (`nidana/docs/SPEC.md`).
- [ ] Sambhasha: move the domain models and the importer from schema 0.2 to 0.3 (Sambhasha PLAN P0.2 and P0.6); map Gatekeeper requests, and before scoring the Commit and each service report, to catalogue ids (D-022, P1.2 and P1.8).
